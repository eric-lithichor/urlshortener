## Caveats

I'm not a C# developer, so I don't know all the conventions for this language - 
both times I worked as a developer I worked in Java

I'm working on a Mac laptop, not Windows. I don't know how portable C# code is 
between OSs, but I used to have those sorts of problems with Java

I used VS Code for this project, and ran it in the terminal - in case that 
makes a difference:
- dotnet build
- dotnet UrlShortener/bin/Debug/net9.0/UrlShortener.dll
